# Build Source Project

## Description

This skill helps you create a `pyproject.toml` for a source connector that can be built and distributed as an independent Python package. It includes the correct dependencies (interface and libs from the main project, but not pipeline or sparkpds) and provides the commands to set up a virtual environment and build the package.

## Instructions
Read and follow **[prompts/build_source_project.md](../../../prompts/build_source_project.md)**
